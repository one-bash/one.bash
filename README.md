  <b>Make Bash Great Again!</b>
</p>

An elegant framework to manage commands, completions, dotfiles for bash players.

[English](./README.md) | [ä¸­æ–‡](./README.zh.md)

## Features

- Manage collections of dotfiles in one place. Using YAML file to manage soft-links via [dotbot][].
- Manage shell scripts, completions, aliases by [modules][one-module]. Support custom modules.
- Easy to share and reuse executable files, sub commands, configs and modules by [repo][one-repo]. Support custom repo and multiple repos.
- Manage commands under your own scope. Like `a <cmd>` to invoke command that no worry about duplicated in `PATH`. Read the [ONE_SUB Commands][one-sub].
- Configurable one.bash. Read [ONE_CONF](#oneconf).
- Support [bash-it][] via [one-bash-it][]. You can use `one` commands to manage bash-it's aliases/completions/plugins. Read [bash-it.md](./docs/advanced-usage/bash-it.md).

## Environments

- âœ… iTerm2
- âœ… Terminal.app
- âœ… MacOS 13 and above (Intel/ARM Arch)
- âœ… Linux/Unix system
- ðŸš« Windows system
- ðŸš« Zsh. This project is just for Bash players. Zsh players should use [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

## Versions

See [releases][].
The versions follows the rules of [SemVer 2.0.0](http://semver.org/).

## Requires

- GNU Bash 4.4 or 5.0+
- [python3](https://www.python.org/)
- [perl 5](https://github.com/Perl/perl5)
- [git](https://github.com/git/git)
- sed, awk, grep, find

## Inspired By

one.bash is inspired by [sub][] and [bash-it][].

- sub: A delicious way to organize programs created by basecamp. But no more maintained.
- bash-it: A community Bash framework.

## Who uses one.bash

See https://github.com/topics/one-bash

( You can add `one-bash` topic in your Github project for sharing. )

## Installation

```sh
# Set the directory for download one.bash
ONE_DIR=~/.one.bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/one-bash/one.bash.git $ONE_DIR
# Note: you should ensure /usr/local/bin/ is in environment variable PATH
sudo ln -s "$ONE_DIR/bin/one" /usr/local/bin/one

# Install Dependencies
one dep install

# Add one.bash to your bashrc. Or you can add the result of "one --bashrc" to bashrc by manual.
echo '' >> ~/.bashrc
one --bashrc >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Upgrade

```sh
# upgrade one.bash and its dependencies to latest version
one upgrade
# check the status of all dependencies
one dep status
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Add a repo
one repo add one-bash/one.share
one repo add Bash-it/bash-it

# List available plugins/completions/aliases/bins/subs
one plugin list -a
one completion list -a
one alias list -a
one bin list -a
one sub list -a

# Enable modules on demand
# one plugin enable <name>
# one completion enable <name>

# Restart your shell
```

If shell has any critical issue and failed to start up, try `ONE_RC=<path-to-your-rcfile>` to change bashrc for rescue.

## Configuration

### ONE_CONF

`ONE_CONF` is the filepath of one.bash configuration.
The file is not required. one.bash has [default config](./one.config.default.bash).

```bash
ONE_CONF=${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/one.bash/one.config.bash
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$ONE_CONF")"

# Create your dotfiles on any path.
DOTFILES_DIR=$HOME/.dotfiles
mkdir -p "$DOTFILES_DIR"

cat <<-EOF >"$ONE_CONF"
DOTFILES_DIR="$DOTFILES_DIR"

ONE_DEBUG=false
ONE_LINKS_CONF() {
  case "$1" in
    *) echo "$DOTFILES_DIR"/one.links.yaml ;;
  esac
}
EOF

. "$ONE_CONF"
```

For more `ONE_CONF` options and documents, Please read [./one.config.default.bash][one.config.default].

You can use `one config <key>=<val>` set config option. (function and array are not supported)

And `one config <key>` to query config option.

### ONE_DIR

`ONE_DIR` is the directory where the one.bash located. This is a constant and does not need user to set.

### ONE_CONF_DIR

`ONE_CONF_DIR` is the directory where the ONE_CONF file located. This is a constant and does not need user to set.

### ONE_LINKS_CONF

`ONE_LINKS_CONF` can be a string, an array of strings, and a function. The default value is `$ONE_CONF_DIR/one.links.yaml`.

The `one link` and `one unlink` commands read the contents of the `ONE_LINKS_CONF` file to manage symbolic links.
**Notice: Do not invoke `one link` and `one unlink` with sudo.**

The contents of the `ONE_LINKS_CONF` file uses the [dotbot configuration](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot#configuration).

There is a dotbot config template [one.links.example.yaml][]. You can copy its content to `one.links.yaml`.

<!-- You can use [dotbot plugins](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot#plugins) for more directives. -->
<!-- See https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/wiki/Plugins -->

#### ONE_LINKS_CONF Array

It can be used to manage multiple ONE_LINKS_CONF files for splitting and reuse.

```sh
ONE_LINKS_CONF=("/a/one.links.yaml" "/b/one.lins.yaml")
```

#### ONE_LINKS_CONF Function

`ONE_LINKS_CONF` can be a Bash function that returns a filepath of [dotbot][] config. Defaults to empty.

This function receives two parameters: OS (`uname -s`), Arch (`uname -m`).The ONE_LINKS_CONF path must be returned with `echo`.

It is used for managing different [dotbot][] configs for different environments (such as MacOS and Linux).

```bash
# User should print the filepath of ONE_LINKS_CONF
# User can print multiple filepaths
# @param os   $(uname -s)
# @param arch $(uname -m)
ONE_LINKS_CONF() {
  local os=$1
  local arch=$2
  case "$os_$arch" in
    Darwin_arm64)
      echo "$DOTFILES_DIR"/links/macos_common.yaml
      echo "$DOTFILES_DIR"/links/macos_arm.yaml
      ;;
    Darwin_amd64)
      echo "$DOTFILES_DIR"/links/macos_common.yaml
      echo "$DOTFILES_DIR"/links/macos_intel.yaml
      ;;
    Linux*) echo "$DOTFILES_DIR"/links/linux.yaml ;;
  esac
}
```

## Usage

The `one` command is used to manage one.bash [repos][one-repo] and [modules][one-module], one.config, and dependencies.
