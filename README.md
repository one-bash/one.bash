  <b>Make Bash Great Again!</b>
</p>

An elegant framework to manage commands, completions, dotfiles for bash players.

[English](./README.md) | [ä¸­æ–‡](./README.zh.md)

## Features

- Manage collections of dotfiles in one place. Using YAML file to manage soft-links via [dotbot][].
- Manage shell scripts, completions, aliases by [modules](#modules). Support custom modules.
- Easy to share and reuse executable files, sub commands, configs and modules by [repo](#one-repo). Support custom repo and multiple repos.
- Manage commands under your own scope. Like `a <cmd>` to invoke command that no worry about duplicated in `PATH`. Read the [ONE_SUB Commands](./docs/advanced-usage/one-sub-cmd.md).
- Configurable one.bash. Read [ONE_CONF](#oneconf).
- Support [bash-it][] via [one-bash-it][]. You can use `one` commands to manage bash-it's aliases/completions/plugins. Read [bash-it.md](./docs/advanced-usage/bash-it.md).
- Support [Fig][]. Read [docs/advanced-usage/fig.md](./docs/advanced-usage/fig.md).

## Environments

- âœ… iTerm2
- âœ… Terminal.app

## Versions

See [tags][].
The versions follows the rules of [SemVer 2.0.0](http://semver.org/).

## Dependencies

### Requires

- GNU Bash 4.4 or 5.0+
- [python3](https://www.python.org/)
- [perl 5](https://github.com/Perl/perl5)
- [git](https://github.com/git/git)

## Inspired By

one.bash is inspired by [sub][] and [bash-it][].

- sub: A delicious way to organize programs created by basecamp. But no more maintained.
- bash-it: A community Bash framework.

## Who uses one.bash

See https://github.com/topics/one-bash

( You can add `one-bash` topic in your Github project for sharing. )

## Installation

```sh
# Set the directory for download one.bash
ONE_DIR=~/.one.bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/one-bash/one.bash.git $ONE_DIR
# Note: you should ensure /usr/local/bin/ is in environment variable PATH
sudo ln -s "$ONE_DIR/bin/one" /usr/local/bin/one

# Install Dependencies
one dep install

# Add one.bash to your bashrc. Or you can add the result of "one --bashrc" to bashrc by manual.
echo '' >> ~/.bashrc
one --bashrc >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Configuration

### ONE_CONF

`ONE_CONF` is the filepath of one.bash configuration.
The file is not required. one.bash has [default config](./one.config.default.bash).

```sh
ONE_CONF=${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/one.bash/one.config.bash
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$ONE_CONF")"

# Create your dotfiles on any path.
DOTFILES_DIR=$HOME/.dotfiles
mkdir -p "$DOTFILES_DIR"

cat <<-EOF >"$ONE_CONF"
DOTFILES_DIR="$DOTFILES_DIR"

ONE_DEBUG=false
ONE_LINKS_CONF() {
  case "$1" in
    *) echo "$DOTFILES_DIR"/one.links.yaml ;;
  esac
}
EOF

. "$ONE_CONF"
```

For more `ONE_CONF` options and documents, Please read [./one.config.default.bash][one.config.default].

You can use `one config <key>=<val>` set config option. (function and array are not supported)

And `one config <key>` to query config option.

### ONE_LINKS_CONF

`ONE_LINKS_CONF` is a bash function that returns a filepath of [dotbot][] config. Defaults to empty.

This function receives two parameters: OS (`uname -s`), Arch (`uname -m`).
It is used for managing different [dotbot][] configs for different environments (such as MacOS and Linux).

```sh
# User should print the path of ONE_LINKS_CONF file
# @param os   $(uname -s)
# @param arch $(uname -m)
ONE_LINKS_CONF() {
  local os=$1
  local arch=$2
  case "$os_$arch" in
    Darwin_arm64) echo "$DOTFILES_DIR"/links/macos_arm.yaml ;;
    Darwin_amd64) echo "$DOTFILES_DIR"/links/macos_intel.yaml ;;
    Linux*) echo "$DOTFILES_DIR"/links/linux.yaml ;;
  esac
}
```

The [dotbot][] is a tool to manage symbol links of dotfiles and any other files. It is a part of one.bash.
You can use it to create symbol links to any files.

[one.share][] provides a dotbot config template [one.links.example.yaml][]. You can copy its content to `one.links.yaml`.

Invoke `one link` to create symbol links based on ONE_LINKS_CONF file.
**Notice: Do not invoke `one link` with sudo.**

Invoke `one unlink` to remove all symbol links based on ONE_LINKS_CONF file.

You can use [dotbot plugins](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot#plugins) for more directives.
See https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/wiki/Plugins

Desc:
    An elegant framework to manage commands, completions, dotfiles for terminal players.
    Source code: https://github.com/one-bash/one.bash

Arguments:
    <CMD>                       The one command
    <SUB_CMD>                   The ONE_SUB command
```

## Modules

one.bash uses modules to manage shell scripts.

User can use `one` commands to manage modules. Enable/Disable modules on your demand.

The modules have three types: `alias`, `completion`, `plugin`.

- All plugins are put in `plugins/` of each repo.
- All completions are put in `completions/` of each repo.
- All aliases are put in `aliases/` of each repo.
- All enabled modules are symbol linked in `$ONE_DIR/enabled/` directory.
  - `one enabled` to view enabled modules.
  - `one backup` to backup enabled modules to a file.
- Read `one help <mod_type>` for usages.
- `one <mod_type> enable` to enable modules.
- `one <mod_type> disable` to disable modules.
- `one <mod_type> list` to list modules.

[one.share][] has provided many modules, configs, ONE_SUB commands, and bin commands.

It's suggested to move your shell codes to modules for management.

Read the [Module document](./docs/advanced-usage/module.md) for details.

## One Repo

one.bash is just a management framework. It does not contain any dotfiles, configs.
The official repo [one.share][] and [one-bash-it][] provides them to enhance shell.

- List all local repos: `one repo list`
- Download and enable repo:
  - `one repo add https://github.com/one-bash/one.share`
  - `one repo add git@github.com:one-bash/one.share.git`
  - `one repo add /local/directory`
- Enable repo: `one repo enable one.share`
- Disable repo: `one repo disable one.share`
- Update repo: `one repo update one.share`
- Remove repo: `one repo remove one.share`
- Create repo: You can create your own repo. Read the [document](./docs/advanced-usage/repo.md#create-repo) for details.


## ONE_SUB Commands

All executable files in `sub/` of each [repo](./docs/advanced-usage/repo.md) could be invoked
by `one subs <cmd>` or `a <cmd>` (`$ONE_SUB <cmd>`, `ONE_SUB` defaults to `a`, read the usage in [`ONE_CONF`][one.config.default]).

The `sub/` path is not included in `$PATH`. So you cannot invoke ONE_SUB commands directly.

Read [this document](./docs/advanced-usage/one-sub-cmd.md) for more details.
