  <b>Make Bash Great Again!</b>
</p>

A modular framework that manages commands, completions, dotfiles for bash users.

[English](./README.md) | [ä¸­æ–‡](./README.zh.md)

## Features

- Links: Manage collections of dotfiles in one place. Using `one link` and `one unlink` based on YAML files to manage soft-links. See [ONE Links](./docs/advanced-usage/links.md) for details.
- Modules: Manage shell scripts, completions, aliases, commands (bins), sub-commands (subs) by [modules][one-module]. Support custom modules.
- Repo: Package shell scripts, completions, aliases, commands by [repo][one-repo] for sharing and reusing. Support custom repo and multiple repos.
- Sub-commands: Manage commands under your own scope. Like `a <cmd>` to invoke command that no worry about duplicated in `PATH`. Read the [ONE_SUB Commands][one-sub].
- Configurable one.bash: Read [ONE_CONF](#oneconf).
- Support [bash-it][] via [one-bash-it][]: You can use all aliases/completions/plugins from [bash-it][] via `one` command.

## Environments

- âœ… iTerm2
- âœ… Terminal.app
- âœ… MacOS 13 and above (Intel/ARM Arch)
- âœ… Linux/Unix system
- ðŸš« Windows system
- ðŸš« Zsh. This project is just for Bash users. Zsh players should use [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

## Versions

See [releases][].
The versions follows the rules of [SemVer 2.0.0](http://semver.org/).

## Requires

- GNU Bash 4.4 or 5.0+
- [python3](https://www.python.org/)
- [perl 5](https://github.com/Perl/perl5)
- [git](https://github.com/git/git)
- sed, awk, grep, find

## Inspired By

one.bash is inspired by [sub][] and [bash-it][].

- sub: A delicious way to organize programs created by basecamp. But no more maintained.
- bash-it: A community Bash framework.

## Who uses one.bash

See https://github.com/topics/one-bash

( You can add `one-bash` topic in your Github project for sharing. )

## Installation

```sh
# Set the directory for download one.bash
ONE_DIR=~/.one.bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/one-bash/one.bash.git $ONE_DIR
# Note: you should ensure /usr/local/bin/ is in environment variable PATH
sudo ln -s "$ONE_DIR/bin/one" /usr/local/bin/one

# Install Dependencies
one dep install

# Add one.bash to your bashrc. Or you can add the result of "one --bashrc" to bashrc by manual.
echo '' >> ~/.bashrc
one --bashrc >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Upgrade

```sh
# upgrade one.bash and its dependencies to latest version
one upgrade
# check the status of all dependencies
one dep status
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Add a repo
one repo add one-bash/one.share
one repo add one-bash/bash-it

# List available plugins/completions/aliases/bins/subs
one plugin list -a
one completion list -a
one alias list -a
one bin list -a
one sub list -a

# Enable modules on demand
# one plugin enable <name>
# one completion enable <name>

# Restart your shell
```

### Notice

1. After enable or disable any module, it is required to restart the current shell for changes to take effect.
2. When shell has any critical issue and failed to start up, edit your [ONE_CONF](#oneconf) file via `one config --edit`. And set `ONE_RC=<path-to-your-rcfile>` to change bashrc for rescue.

### one link

Create a yaml file at `$HOME/.config/one.bash/one.links.yaml`.

```yaml
# It is just an example. All belows are unnecessary.
- defaults:
    link:
      # relink: true # If true, override the target file when it existed
      create: true

# ONE_SHARE_DIR is the filepath of repo https://github.com/one-bash/one.share
# You must enable the repo one.share before invoking "one link"
- link:
    # configs
    ~/.tmux.conf: $ONE_SHARE_DIR/configs/tmux/tmux.conf
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bat/config: $ONE_SHARE_DIR/configs/bat
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/starship.toml: $ONE_SHARE_DIR/configs/starship.toml
```

Invoke `one link` to create soft-link files.
