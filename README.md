  <b>Make Bash Great Again!</b>
</p>

An elegant framework to manage commands, completions, dotfiles for terminal players.

## Features

- Manage collections of dotfiles in one place. Using YAML file to manage soft-links via [dotbot][].
- Manage shell scripts, completions, aliases by [modules](#modules). Support custom modules.
- Easy to share and reuse executable files, sub commands, configs and modules by [repo](#onerepos). Read [one.share][]. And suspport custom repo.
- Manage commands under scope. Like `a <cmd>` to invoke command that no worry about duplicated in `PATH`. Read the [ONE_SUB Commands](./docs/advanced-usage/one-sub-cmd.md).
- Support custom one.bash. Read [ONE_CONF](#oneconf).
- Support [bash-it][]. You can use one.bash commands to manage bash-it's aliases/completions/plugins. Read [./docs/advanced-usage/bash-it.md](./docs/advanced-usage/bash-it.md).
- Support [Fig][]. Read [./docs/advanced-usage/fig.md](./docs/advanced-usage/fig.md).

## Environments

- ‚úÖ iTerm2 (Terminal.app compatible)
- ‚úÖ MacOS Intel Arch
- ‚úÖ MacOS ARM Arch
- ‚úÖ Linux/Unix system
- üö´ Windows system
- üö´ Zsh. This project is just for Bash players. Zsh players should use [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

## CI Status

- [develop branch](https://github.com/one-bash/one.bash/tree/develop): [![CI Status](https://github.com/one-bash/one.bash/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/one-bash/one.bash/actions/workflows/ci.yaml?query=branch%3Adevelop)

## Dependencies

### Requires

- GNU Bash 4.4 or 5.0+
- [python3](https://www.python.org/)
- [perl 5](https://github.com/Perl/perl5)
- [git](https://github.com/git/git)

## Inspired By

one.bash is inspired by [sub][] and [bash-it][].

- sub: A delicious way to organize programs created by basecamp. But no more maintained.
- bash-it: A community Bash framework.

## Who uses one.bash

See https://github.com/topics/one-bash

( You can add `one-bash` topic in your Github project for sharing. )

## Installation

```sh
# Set your Dotfiles directory path
ONE_DIR=~/.one.bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/one-bash/one.bash.git $ONE_DIR
sudo ln -s "$ONE_DIR/bin/one" /usr/local/bin/one

# Install Dependencies
one dep install

# Add one.bash to your bashrc. Or you can add the result of "one --bashrc" to bashrc by manual.
echo '' >> ~/.bashrc
one --bashrc >> ~/.bashrc

# Restart shell
```

## Configuration

### ONE_CONF

`ONE_CONF` is the filepath of one.bash configuration. The file is not required. one.bash has default config.

```sh
ONE_CONF=${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/one.bash/one.config.bash
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$ONE_CONF")"

# Create your dotfiles on any path.
DOTFILES_DIR=$HOME/.dotfiles
mkdir -p "$DOTFILES_DIR"

cat <<-EOF >"$ONE_CONF"
DOTFILES_DIR="$DOTFILES_DIR"

ONE_DEBUG=false
ONE_REPOS=(
  "$DOTFILES_DIR"
)
ONE_LINKS_CONF() {
  case "$1" in
    *) echo "$DOTFILES_DIR"/one.links.yaml ;;
  esac
}
EOF

. "$ONE_CONF"
```

For more `ONE_CONF` options and documents, Please read [./one.config.default.bash][one.config.default].

### ONE_LINKS_CONF

`ONE_LINKS_CONF` is a bash function that returns a filepath of [dotbot][] config.

[dotbot][] is used to manage symbol links of dotfiles (or any files). You can use the [dotfiles from one.share][one.share] or your own dotfiles.

The default `ONE_LINKS_CONF` return empty. User should defined yours in ONE_CONF file.

```sh
# User should print the path of ONE_LINKS_CONF file
# @param os type
ONE_LINKS_CONF() {
  case "$1" in
    MacOS) echo "$DOTFILES_DIR"/links/macos.yaml ;;
    Linux) echo "$DOTFILES_DIR"/links/debian.yaml ;;
  esac
}
```

You can copy the [one.links.example.yaml][] from [one.share][] to your directory.

```sh
cp "$ONE_SHARE_DIR"/one.links.example.yaml "$DOTFILES_DIR"/one.links.yaml
# Edit the one.links.yaml for your demand
$EDITOR "$DOTFILES_DIR"/one.links.yaml
```

Invoke `one link` to create symbol links based on ONE_LINKS_CONF file.
**Notice: Do not invoke `one link` with sudo.**

Invoke `one unlink` to remove all links defined in ONE_LINKS_CONF file.

You can use [dotbot plugins](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot#plugins) for more directives.
See https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/wiki/Plugins

## Usage

## ONE Commands

The `one` command is used to manage one.bash modules, one.config, and dependencies.

Invoke `one` to show usage of it.

```
Usage: one [<CMD>]                 Run one command
       one subs [<SUB_CMD>]        Run ONE_SUB command
       one help [<CMD>]            Show the usage of one command
       one help-sub [<SUB_CMD>]    Show the usage of ONE_SUB command
       one [--bashrc]              Print one.bash entry codes for bashrc
       one [-h|--help]             Show the usage of one

Desc: An elegant framework to manage commands, completions, dotfiles for terminal players.
      https://github.com/one-bash/one.bash

Arguments:
  <CMD> the command of one
  <SUB_CMD> the command of ONE_SUB
```

It provides many commands defined in [./one-cmds/](./one-cmds).

- `one commands` to list all commands.
- `one help -a` to list all usages of commands.
- `one bin list` to show all executable files in `bin/` of each repo.
- `one sub list` to show all commands in `sub/` of each repo.
- `one config <key>=<val>` and `one config <key>` to set and query config option.
- `one debug true|false` to enable/disable debug mode

## Modules

one.bash uses modules to manage shell scripts.

User can use `one` commands to manage modules. Enable/Disable modules on your demand.

The modules have three types: `alias`, `completion`, `plugin`.

- All plugins are put in `plugins/` of each repo.
- All completions are put in `completions/` of each repo.
- All aliases are put in `aliases/` of each repo.
- All enabled modules are symbol linked in `$ONE_DIR/enabled/` directory.
- Read `one help <mod_type>` for usages.
- `one <mod_type> enable` to enable modules.
- `one <mod_type> disable` to disable modules.
- `one <mod_type> list` to list modules.

[one.share][] has provided many modules, configs, sub commands, and bin commands.

It's suggested to move your shell codes to modules.

Read the [Module document](./docs/advanced-usage/module.md) for details.

### Enabled Modules

All enabled modules are under [$ONE_DIR/enabled/](./enabled).

`one enabled list` to view enabled modules.

`one enabled backup` to backup enabled modules to a file.

## ONE_REPOS

one.bash is just a management framework. It does not contain any dotfiles, configs.
The official repo [one.share][] provides them to enhance shell.

one.bash enable [one.share][] and [bash-it][] by default.
You can disable them by `ONE_SHARE_ENABLE=false` and `ONE_BASH_IT_ENABLE=false` in `ONE_CONF`.

You can create your own ONE repo. Read the [Create Repo](./docs/advanced-usage/repo.md#create-repo) for details.

Just add repo's filepath to `ONE_REPOS` to enable the repo, or remove from `ONE_REPOS` to disable it.

Invoke `one repo l` to list ONE repos based on `ONE_CONF`.

## ONE_SUB Commands

All executable files in `sub/` of each [repo](./docs/advanced-usage/repo.md) could be invoked
by `one subs <cmd>` or `a <cmd>` (`$ONE_SUB <cmd>`, `ONE_SUB` defaults to `a`, read the usage in [`ONE_CONF`][one.config.default]).

The `sub/` path is not included in `$PATH`. So you cannot invoke ONE_SUB commands directly.

Read [this document](./docs/advanced-usage/one-sub-cmd.md) for more details.
