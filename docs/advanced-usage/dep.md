# ONE Dependencies

Dependencies:

- [dotbot][]: Create symbol links and manage them with config.
- [composure][]: Provide basic functions for modules.

You can use `one dep` to manage these dependencies.

- `one dep install` to install all dependencies into [deps/](../../deps).
- `one dep update` to update all dependencies.
- `one dep update <dep>` to update a dependency.
