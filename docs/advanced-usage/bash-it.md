# Bash-it

You can use one.bash commands to manage bash-it's aliases/completions/plugins.

Just read the [one-bash-it][].

## Notice

1. Set Bash-it configuration in your `ONE_CONF`.
2. Do not use [bash-it commands](https://bash-it.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/).
3. Enable bash-it aliases/completions/plugins with `one` commands. For example, enable aliases.completion by `one completion enable aliases.completion`.
